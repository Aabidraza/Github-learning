echo and print----> echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.

		The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print.
		
(A)----->The echo statement can be used with or without parentheses: echo or echo().

(1)
<?php
echo "<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>";

Hello world!
I'm about to learn PHP!
This string was made with multiple parameters.
*/
?>

$x = 5;
$y = 4;

echo "<h2>" . $txt1 . "</h2>";
echo "Study PHP at " . $txt2 . "<br>";
echo $x + $y;
/*

echo $one, $two;
//HelloWorld
?>

(8)
<?php
$one = "Hello";
$two = "World";
echo "$one$two";
//HelloWorld
Explanation: Even though both the variables are inside the double-quotes, the value of the variable is substituted and then printed to the screen.
?>

(9)
<?php
$one = "Hello";
$two = "World";
echo "$one"+"$two";
//0

//onetwo
Explanation: This is same as the echo statement.
?>

(8)

$one = "one";
$two = "two";
print($one==$two);
//nothing
Explanation: Since we are equating two unequal strings we do not get any output.
