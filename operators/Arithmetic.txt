Operators------>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

PHP divides the operators in the following groups:

(1)Arithmetic operators
(2)Assignment operators
(3)Comparison operators
(4)Increment/Decrement operators
(5)Logical operators
(6)String operators
(7)Array operators

(1)Arithmetic operators ---->The PHP arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common arithmetical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.

 operator    Name                 Example     Result
      +		Addition             $x + $y	 Sum of $x and $y
      -         Subtraction          $x - $y     Difference of $x and $y	
      *         Multiplication       $x * $y     Product of $x and $y
      /         Division             $x / $y     Quotient of $x and $y
      %         Modulus              $x % $y     Remainder of $x divided by $y
      **        Exponentiation       $x ** $y    Result of raising $x to the $y'th power (Introduced in PHP 5.6)

<?php
$x = 10;  
$y = 6;

echo $x + $y;
//16

echo $x - $y;
//4

echo $x * $y;
//60

echo $x / $y;
//1.6666666666667

echo $x % $y;
//4

?>
